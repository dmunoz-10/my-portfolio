          <p className="text-xl">
            I'm currently working as a back-end developer with Ruby on Rails, although sometimes
            I work on some personal frontend projects in ReactJs and VueJs. I'm so passionate at
            coding and learn new stuff every day by myself.<br/><br/>

            I usually code on Linux, actually I like Kubuntu distribution, I think is easier and
            less painful to code on Linux than on Windows. Ruby is actually my favorite programming
            language and Rails my favorite framework, I think both are great technologies for web
            development, and NOT, Ruby is NOT dead, if you don't believe me, just
            check <a href="https://isrubydead.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> out üòâ.<br/><br/>

            I'm a cinephile, my favorite movie is <strong>Donnie Darko</strong>, is an amazing movie,
            the first time I saw it, it hit right in my feels when I was younger.
            I'm also a <strong>Naruto</strong> fan, a great and mature anime that has gained a lot of
            fans around the world, and lately <strong>Berserk</strong> has become one of my favorite
            mangas. Sometimes I like to read, I've read some of Stephen King's books: Carrie, Misery
            and Mr. Mercedes, I'll probably read more books of this amazing author. And I think there's
            no more things to say, just one last thing, I like pizza with pineapple üôÇüçï.
